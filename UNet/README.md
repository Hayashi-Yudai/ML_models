# U-Net

UNet is the semantic segmentation network proposed by O. Ronneberger, P. Fischer, and T. Brox in the [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597). This repository is the implementation of this model by the Python with the Tensorflow.

## Network structure

ArcFace adds a penalty to the normal ResNet50/100 output and separate the distance of each class. This network is used to face recognition.

In use of ArcFace, we use 512-dims vectors as embeddigs.
